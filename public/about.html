<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings. I am Jerin P Jose from Bangalore, Karnataka in India.  I am originally from Kerala. my parents shifted to Bangalore in the late 90s
  Thus now Bangalore being my residence. I did my schooling till !2th in karnataka and for further studies God sent me to tamil nadu where i am doing my 
  Bachelors in engineering. And currently pursuing Electronics and communications. Turns out with the advent of Artificial intelligence and the already
  present robustness in ECE concepts, I am  Thrilled to grow and learn more along the journey than the destination.
</p>

<p>My Parents and my brother are residing in karnataka. With support and love for my wellbeing , they educate me for the better of family and society.
My close relatives are in Kerala where the importance of family larg3er than the nuclear one teaches the uniqueness of family.
With my Church praying for me, that enlightens me about the unity of God's people and my need of God who has always taken care of me.
ALso a bunch of nitwits i call friends who taught me true humility and to share and care rising above one's personal interest</p>

<p>The Journey has began and i know that the One who called me will give the grace to live his will.
  Rather the meagre destinationa and success without true benefit does not give anything. The journey with every moment unpredictable, with moments
  feeling confused or unlearnt which allows for humility and recognise the talents and not take anything for granted.
To enjoy learning with a childlike curiosity to see things from perspectives hitherto unknown and do the best for my team. Be it family or Church or friends or coworkers, to uplift them without selfish ambiton.
ANd my God shall Complete his Glorious purpose in me through Christ Jesus, our Lord.
